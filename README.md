Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite Project Documentation: How to Copy, Install, and Run
This guide will walk you through the steps to copy, install, and run a Vue 3 project with TypeScript and Vite. Vite is a fast, modern build tool that is designed for speed and optimized development.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your machine:

Node.js: Vue 3 and Vite require Node.js version 14.18.0 or higher. You can download it from here.

NPM: NPM comes bundled with Node.js. You can check if it’s installed by running npm -v in your terminal.

Step 1: Copy the Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite Project
You can either clone a project from a Git repository or download it manually. The easiest way is to use Git to clone the repository.

Option 1: Clone the Repository (if using Git)
If you have a Git repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/haryus/frontend-coding-exam.git
Option 2: Download as ZIP
If the project is available as a ZIP file, you can download it and extract the files to your preferred directory.

Step 2: Install Project Dependencies
After copying the project to your local machine, you need to install the required dependencies for both Node.js and TypeScript.

Navigate to the Project Folder
Open your terminal or command prompt, and navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd vue3-typescript-vite-project
Install NPM Dependencies
Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This will install all the dependencies defined in the package.json file.

Step 3: Verify TypeScript Configuration
The project should already be set up with TypeScript. However, ensure that the tsconfig.json file exists and is correctly configured for Vue 3 and TypeScript support.

Here is an example of the relevant portion of tsconfig.json:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "lib": ["dom", "esnext"]
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts",
    "src/**/*.d.ts",
    "src/**/*.tsx",
    "src/**/*.vue"
  ]
}
This configuration ensures proper TypeScript support for .vue files and enables strict type checking for your project.

Step 4: Run the Development Server
Vite provides a fast development server that you can use to run your project locally.

Start the Vite Development Server
Once you’ve installed all dependencies, run the following command to start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser at the URL:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:5173/
Step 5: Optional: Build the Project for Production
Once you're ready to deploy your Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite project to production, you can create an optimized production build using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
This will create a production-ready build in the dist/ folder.

Step 6: Optional: Configure IDE Support
To maximize productivity, ensure your IDE is properly configured for Vue 3 and TypeScript. Popular IDEs like VS Code work well with Vue 3 and TypeScript with the following extensions:

Vetur: Vue tooling for VS Code (provides syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and more).

Volar: A more robust Vue 3 extension, recommended for Vue 3 projects using TypeScript.

ESLint: Linting for TypeScript and Vue files to enforce consistent code quality.

Recommended VS Code Extensions
Volar (Vue 3 support with TypeScript)

Vetur (Vue 2 support, if needed)

ESLint (for code linting)

Prettier (for code formatting)

Step 7: Debugging and Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, here are some common solutions:

Clear Node Modules and Reinstall Dependencies
Sometimes, there may be issues with the node_modules folder. You can try deleting it and reinstalling the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
Check Console for Errors
If the development server is not working, check the terminal console for any errors that may be preventing it from starting. Often, Vite will output helpful error messages that can guide you toward the solution.

Conclusion
You’ve now successfully copied, installed, and run a Vue 3 project with TypeScript and Vite! This setup allows you to take advantage of Vue 3's reactivity, TypeScript's strong typing, and Vite's fast build times, all of which provide an excellent development experience.
